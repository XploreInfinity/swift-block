## CHANGELOG

**Version 0.3-beta:**

* Created a Pypi package
* Several improvements and bug fixes in `elevate`
* Adjustments in code to adapt swift_block to run as a package
* Swift-Block will now create a launcher/start menu shortcut on first run
* Added an uninstaller

**Version 0.2-beta:**

* Windows testing completed.
* Fixed: a bug where some GUI icons didn't load due to an invalid stylesheet
* Fixed: ghost windows bug[which, punnily enough, only affected the Windows OS] in which the home window persists even after opening the RuleManager window.
* Fixed: a typo in the URL of the 'License' button.
* Added support to open external links through the browser(Windows only,as other platforms consider this action insecure).
* Fixed: the background of swiftblock's status page not loading on some platforms when swiftblock is disabled.
